<p>Today, I found an interesting tool developed by Bittorrent. Its name is Bittorrent Sync. It use P2P technology to&nbsp;synchronization data between computer. It's quite useful for me to transport file among my computers.</p>
<p>P2P is really an useful technology. A few days ago, I was trying to create a software that use P2P to make a tunnel between two computer behind two NAT gateway. I know there is some standard way for this. More specifically, I need a tool to ssh another computer behind &nbsp;another NAT. But only STUN cannot&nbsp;meet this&nbsp;demand.</p>
<p>I was confused about why I can't find any existing projects make tunnel using P2P. I tried to create a new one for myself. But It's a little bit hard for me due to the leak of library for P2P.</p>
<p>Finally, I turned to use&nbsp;Instant Messaging way to transmit command. And I create another project to handle python code using XMPP.You can find the code here. It's useful for me to monitor some of my program.</p>
<p>But I still want to build a general tool for tunnel using P2P. I know it's slow for P2P to establish the connection, but it become quick after that. I think this idea is possible.</p>
